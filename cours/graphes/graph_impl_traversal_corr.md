## Directed graph
A ***directed graph*** or ***digraph*** $G = (V, A)$ with $n$ ***vertices*** and $m$ ***arcs*** consists of:

* $V = V(G)$ : a vertex set; $n = |V|$ is the order of $G$
* $A = A(G)$ : a set of ordered pairs of vertices, called arcs; $m = |A|$

# Adjacency lists
## Adjacency lists

The *adjacency-list* representation of $G = (V,E)$ is an array `Adj` composed of $|V|$ lists.
For each node $u \in V(G)$, the adjacency list `Adj[u]` contains all the successors of $u$.

# Adjacency matrix
## Adjacency matrix

For a digraph $G$ of order $n$, the **adjacency matrix** $M(G)$ is a $n \times n$ matrix which coefficients verify:

* $M_{ij} = 1$ if there exists an arc ${i,j} \in A(G)$;
* $M_{ij} = 0$ otherwise.

(If $G$ is undirected, $M_{ij} = M_{ji} = 1$ if $\{i,j\} \in E(G)$ and $M_{ij} = M_{ji} = 0$ otherwise.)

## Adjacency matrix vs Adjacency lists

A digraph with $n$ ***vertices*** and $m$ ***arcs*** :

* Space complexity :
	* matrix : $O(|V|^2) = O(n^2)$
	* list : $O(|V| + |A|) = O(n + m)$

\pause

* A graph is **sparse** when $m$ is much less than $n^2$. In this case the adjacency-list representation provides a compact way to represent a graph.

\pause

* A graph is **dense** when $m$ is close to $n^2$. In this case may prefer the adjacency-matrix representation, because these matrices are simpler and have useful mathematical properties.

## Adjacency matrix: mathematical results

* There is a path of **length 2** between $i, j \in V(G)$ if there exists a $k \in V(G)$ such that $M_{ik} \cdot M_{kj} = 1$.

\pause

* Therefore, there exists a path of length 2 between $i, j \in V(G)$ if and only if $\sum_{k \in V(G)} M_{ik} \cdot M_{kj} = M_{ij}^2\geqslant 1$.

0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix} $
\end{column}%
\end{columns}

\pause

* $M_{ij}^k$ is the number of paths of length $k$ starting at $i$ and ending at $j$.

# Depth-first Algorithm
## Depth-first
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{image/traversal/graph.pdf}}

* \[1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 6, 7, 8, 10, 3\]

## Depth-first Algorithm (first version)

```
function DFS(u)
	visit(u);
	visited[u] = true;
	for each v in Adj[u]
		if (!visited[v])
			DFS(v);

DFS(1);
```

1. mark the node $u$ as visited
2. visit (recursively) all the unvisited vertices on $u$'s adjacency list

		visited[u] = false;

	for each vertex u in V(G)
		if (!visited[u])
			DFS-Visit(u);

function DFS-Visit(u)
	visit(u);
	visited[u] = true;
	for each v in Adj[u]
		if (!visited[v])
			DFS-Visit(v);
